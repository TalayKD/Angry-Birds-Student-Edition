Project Description: The name of my term project is Angry Birds: Student Edition. My project will be an implementation of the original Angry Birds game, where the player launches birds with various skills from a slingshot and attempts to hit the pigs. The player will pass any given level if they are able to kill all the pigs either by blasting them off the screen or hitting them with enough force. There is also a "No Gravity Mode" where all objects in the game are not affected by gravity and simulates a space environment.

How to run the project: Run the project by running the TP3main.py file.
